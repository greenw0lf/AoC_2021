# AoC_2021
The code I wrote to solve the challenges of Advent of Code 2021.

Decided to do it in Java to refresh my knowledge of the programming language (and now I regret it).

Might add a NumPy version as well, might not.

## Setup

Just clone the repository and run the file you want since each class has its own main method. Careful to modify the input according to the path you have in the ```Read``` class (check 'Reading files' below).

## Structure of the code

Days are organized in their own packages, and there is a package for reading the input for each day. 
Each of the 2 parts of a day are organized in tasks, and each task has its own class with its own main method.

Might consider switching to proper methods and have a separate class to write the result on the screen.

## Reading files
Make sure to change the ```pathname``` variable to the path of your project accordingly.

## That's it
Nothing else to offer here. Carry on.
